# YAML files

Before running `securityadmin.sh` to load the settings into the `.opendistro_security` index, configure the YAML files in `plugins/opendistro_security/securityconfig`. You might want to back up these files so that you can reuse them on other clusters.

The best use of these YAML files is to configure [reserved and hidden resources](../../access-control/api/#reserved-and-hidden-resources), such as the `admin` and `kibanaserver` users. You might find it easier to create other users, roles, mappings, action groups, and tenants using Kibana or the REST API.


## internal_users.yml

This file contains any initial users that you want to add to the security plugin's internal user database.

The file format requires a hashed password. To generate one, run `plugins/opendistro_security/tools/hash.sh -p <new-password>`. If you decide to keep any of the demo users, *change their passwords*.

```yml
---
# This is the internal user database
# The hash value is a bcrypt hash and can be generated with plugin/tools/hash.sh

_meta:
  type: "internalusers"
  config_version: 2

# Define your internal users here

  hash: "$2y$12$88IFVl6IfIwCFh5aQYfOmuXVL9j2hz/GusQb35o.4sdTDAEMTOD.K"
  reserved: false
  hidden: false
  opendistro_security_roles:
  - "some-security-role"
  backend_roles:
  - "some-backend-role"
  attributes:
    attribute1: "value1"
  static: false

```


## roles.yml

This file contains any initial roles that you want to add to the security plugin. Aside from some metadata, the default file is empty, because the security plugin has a number of static roles that it adds automatically.

```yml

complex-role:
  reserved: false
  hidden: false
  cluster_permissions:
  - "read"
  - "cluster:monitor/nodes/stats"
  - "cluster:monitor/task/get"

    - "kibana_sample_data_*"
    dls: "{\"match\": {\"FlightDelay\": true}}"
    fls:
    - "~FlightNum"
    masked_fields:
    - "Carrier"
    allowed_actions:
    - "read"
  tenant_permissions:
  - tenant_patterns:
    - "analyst_*"
    allowed_actions:
    - "kibana_all_write"
  static: false
_meta:

  config_version: 2
```

## action_groups.yml

This file contains any initial action groups that you want to add to the security plugin.

Aside from some metadata, the default file is empty, because the security plugin has a number of static action groups that it adds automatically. These static action groups cover a wide variety of use cases and are a great way to get started with the plugin.

```yml
---
my-action-group:
  reserved: false
  hidden: false
  allowed_actions:
  - "indices:data/write/index*"
  - "indices:data/write/update*"
  - "indices:admin/mapping/put"
  - "indices:data/write/bulk*"
  - "read"
  - "write"
  static: false
_meta:
  type: "actiongroups"
  config_version: 2
```

## tenants.yml

```yml
---
_meta:
  type: "tenants"
  config_version: 2
admin_tenant:
  reserved: false
  description: "Demo tenant for admin user"
```


## nodes_dn.yml

```yml
---
_meta:
  type: "nodesdn"
  config_version: 2

# Define nodesdn mapping name and corresponding values
# cluster1:
#   nodes_dn:
#       - CN=*.example.com
```
