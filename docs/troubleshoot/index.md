# Troubleshoot

This section contains a list of issues and workarounds.


## Java error during startup

You might see `[ERROR][c.a.o.s.s.t.OpenDistroSecuritySSLNettyTransport] [odfe-node1] SSL Problem Insufficient buffer remaining for AEAD cipher fragment (2). Needs to be more than tag size (16)` when starting Open Distro for Elasticsearch. This problem is a [known issue with Java](https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8221218) and doesn't affect the operation of the cluster.


## Kibana fails to start

If you encounter the error `FATAL  Error: Request Timeout after 30000ms` during startup, try running Kibana on a more powerful machine. We recommend four CPU cores and 8 GB of RAM.


## Can't open Kibana on Windows

Kibana doesn't support Microsoft Edge and many versions of Internet Explorer. We recommend using Firefox or Chrome.


## Can't update by script when FLS, DLS, or field masking is active

The security plugin blocks the update by script operation (`POST <index>/_update/<id>`) when field-level security, document-level security, or field masking are active. You can still update documents using the standard index operation (`PUT <index>/_doc/<id>`).


## Illegal reflective access operation in logs

This is a [known issue](https://github.com/opendistro-for-elasticsearch/performance-analyzer/issues/21) with Performance Analyzer that shouldn't affect functionality.


## Multi-tenancy issues in Kibana

If you're testing multiple users in Kibana and encounter unexpected changes in tenant, use Google Chrome in an Incognito window or Firefox in a Private window.


## Beats

If you encounter compatibility issues when attempting to connect Beats to Open Distro for Elasticsearch, make sure you're using the Apache 2.0 distribution of Beats, not the default distribution, which uses a proprietary license.

As of version 6.7, the default distribution of Beats includes a license check and fails to connect to the Apache 2.0 distribution of Elasticsearch.

Try this minimal output configuration for using Beats with the security plugin:

```yml
output.elasticsearch:
  hosts: ["localhost:9200"]
  protocol: https
  username: "admin"
  password: "admin"
  ssl.certificate_authorities:
    - /full/path/to/root-ca.pem
  ssl.certificate: "/full/path/to/client.pem"
  ssl.key: "/full/path/to/client-key.pem"
```

Even if you use the OSS version, Beats might check for a proprietary plugin on the Elasticsearch server and throw an error during setup. To disable the check, try adding these settings:

```yml
  setup.ilm.enabled: false
  setup.ilm.check_exists: false
```


## Logstash

If you're having trouble connecting Logstash to Open Distro for Elasticsearch, try this minimal output configuration, which works with the security plugin:

```conf
output {
  elasticsearch {
    hosts => ["localhost:9200"]
    index => "logstash-index-test"
    user => "admin"
    password => "admin"
    ssl => true
    cacert => "/full/path/to/root-ca.pem"
    ilm_enabled => false
  }
}
```


## Dependency error during upgrade

If you run `sudo yum upgrade` and receive a dependency error, Elasticsearch likely has a new minor version that the Open Distro for Elasticsearch plugins don't support yet. You can [install a specific, supported version of Elasticsearch](../install/plugins/#compatibility) to resolve the issue.

A temporary solution is to add the `--skip-broken` option to upgrade the rest of your system:

```bash
sudo yum upgrade --skip-broken
```


## Elasticsearch fails to start on Java 8 (RPM install)

If Elasticsearch fails to start and you're using Java 8, verify that you set the symbolic link (symlink) correctly in [step 6](../install/rpm) of the RPM installation. If Java is installed to a non-standard path, try looking for `tools.jar` using the following command:

```bash
ls /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-*/lib/tools.jar
```

Then you can delete the old symlink and create a new one to the corrected path:

```bash
sudo rm /usr/share/elasticsearch/lib/tools.jar
sudo ln -s /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-1.8.0.191.b12-0.amzn2.x86_64/lib/tools.jar /usr/share/elasticsearch/lib/
```
