# Kibana Notebooks

A Kibana notebook is an interface that lets you easily combine live visualizations and narrative text in a single notebook interface.

You can add visualization paragraphs for creating graphs and markdown paragraphs for writing descriptions. You can choose multiple timelines to compare and contrast visualizations.
