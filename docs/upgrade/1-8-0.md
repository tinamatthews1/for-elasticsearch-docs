# Upgrade to 1.8.0

Open Distro for Elasticsearch 1.8.0 includes a breaking change from 1.7.0.


## Anomaly detection plugin

If you use the RPM or Debian installs, the name of the anomaly detection plugin in each package manager has changed from `opendistro-anomaly-detector` to `opendistro-anomaly-detection`. Prior to upgrading, use your package manager to remove the `opendistro-anomaly-detector` package:

```bash
sudo yum remove opendistro-anomaly-detector
sudo apt remove opendistro-anomaly-detector
```
