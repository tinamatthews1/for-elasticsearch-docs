# Upgrade to 1.11.0 (Kibana)

Open Distro for Elasticsearch 1.11.0 renames the SQL Workbench plugin for Kibana to the Query Workbench.

Instead of incrementing the `opendistro_sql_workbench` version number, remove the plugin and install `opendistro-query-workbench` instead, as covered in [Standalone Kibana plugin install](../../kibana/plugins/).
