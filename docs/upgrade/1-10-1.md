# Upgrade to 1.10.1 (Kibana)

Open Distro for Elasticsearch 1.10.1 includes a breaking change for the Kibana security plugin, which now uses the new Kibana plugin platform.


## Kibana security plugin

You must make a manual configuration change if your Kibana install meets these conditions:

* You upgraded Kibana from any of the previous versions to 1.10.1.
* You use the Kibana security plugin version 1.10.1.1 or newer.
* You use unsecured HTTP for the communication protocol.

Add this line to `kibana.yml`, and restart Kibana:

```yml
opendistro_security.cookie.secure: false
```
